# orbital_coverage

This tool delivers insights into the orbital phase coverage of existing NenuFAR/LOFAR observations for a given exoplanet. Additionally, it predicts potential future observation windows, ensuring comprehensive orbital phase coverage.

In detail, the tool performs the following tasks:

1. Identifies existing NenuFAR/LOFAR observations for a specific exoplanet by scanning for relevant data stored on disk.
2. Retrieves the exoplanet's orbital details from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
3. Computes the orbital phase coverage of existing observations, utilizing their timestamps and the exoplanet's orbital information.
4. Forecasts future observation windows for the exoplanet based on its orbital period and the telescope's location.

Outputs generated by the tool include:

1. **Orbital_Phase_Collected** image: A visual representation displaying the timestamps and orbital phases of current observations.
2. **Phase_Coverage_Hist** image: A histogram depicting the orbital phase coverage of existing observations.
3. **Orbital_Slot_Predict** image: A projection indicating upcoming observation windows and their associated orbital phases.
4. **Summary** text: A text document detailing observation timestamps and orbital phases, encompassing both existing data and predictions.


## Installation
Given that the tool searches for directories housing NenuFAR/LOFAR data, it's recommended to execute the code on one of the Nancep machines, ensuring access to /databf or /databf2.

Before running the code, ensure you have Python3 installed.

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib astropy h5py astroquery
```

Then the tool can be installed by simply downloading the repositry.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhangxiang-planet/orbital_coverage
```

## Usage

This tool can be used by executing the orbital_coverage_interactive.py script. To view the help message and understand the available arguments, run: 

```bash
./orbital_coverage_interactive.py -h
```

A list of available arguments is given below:

```
usage: orbital_coverage_interactive.py [-h] -t TARGET -f FIELD [-i INSTRUMENT] [-o OBSERVATION] [-b BADDATA]
                                       [-fmin FREQMIN] [-m MODE] [-p PERIOD] [-pe PERIODERR] [-j JD] [-pre PREDICT]
                                       [-e ELEVATION] [-s SUN] [-l] [-a]

For an exoplanet, this code provides the orbital phase coverage of existing NenuFAR/LOFAR observations, while
predicting future observing windows to cover the entire orbital phase.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        Target name. Must be the same format as used in the NASA exoplanet archive, with spaces
                        replaced with underscores (e.g. tau_boo_b).
  -f FIELD, --field FIELD
                        Field name. Must be the same one used in NenuFAR observations. For example, if field name is
                        TAU_BOO, the code will look for existing observing data directories named with TAU_BOO,
                        while exclude directories with names containing CALIBRATOR.
  -i INSTRUMENT, --instrument INSTRUMENT
                        Telescope used for observation. Can be LOFAR or NENUFAR. For LOFAR, only BEAMFORM
                        observations for TAU BOO are supported for now. Default NENUFAR.
  -o OBSERVATION, --observation OBSERVATION
                        Type of observations to be found. Can be IMAGING or BEAMFORM. Used to search for existing
                        data in nenufar-nri or nenufar-tf directories. Default BEAMFORM.
  -b BADDATA, --baddata BADDATA
                        Bad data list. If True, observations given in the bad data list will be excluded. Default
                        True.
  -fmin FREQMIN, --freqmin FREQMIN
                        Filter previous observations with minimum observing frequency below XX MHz. Only used in
                        BEAMFORM mode. Default 1000.
  -m MODE, --mode MODE  Code driving mode, can be AUTO or MANUAL. If AUTO, the code grabs orbital parameters from
                        NASA exoplanet archive. If MANUAL, the user needs to input orbital parameters. Default AUTO.
  -p PERIOD, --period PERIOD
                        Period of the exoplanet in days. Only used in manual mode. Default 0.
  -pe PERIODERR, --perioderr PERIODERR
                        Period Error of the exoplanet in days. Only used in manual mode. Default 0.
  -j JD, --jd JD        Time of Conjuction (Transit Midpoint) in JD. Only used in manual mode. Default 0.

  -l, --limit           Orbital coverage limit. If set, only give observing window with oribital phase uncovered by
                        previous observations. Default False.
  -a, --avoid           Avoiding observing windows already booked by others. If set, an observing schedule file is
                        required as input. Default False.

## Usage scenarios

1. ***Student A wishes to investigate the exoplanet Kepler-42 c***.

Although one could attempt to use the tool just with the exoplanet's name, it's essential to provide at least two input arguments: the target name and the field name.

- **Target Name**: This is the name of the exoplanet in the NASA exoplanet archive format. Replace spaces with underscores for compatibility. For instance, the target name for Kepler-42 c becomes **kepler_42_c**. While we suggest using lowercase, it seems that the NASA exoplanet archive is case-insensitive.

- **Field Name**: For NenuFAR observations, this is the name utilized during scheduling, which typically corresponds to the star's name. For Kepler-42 c, the field name is **KEPLER_42**. This must be in uppercase due to NenuFAR's naming conventions.

Given this, Student A can execute the command:

```bash
./orbital_coverage_interactive.py -t kepler_42_c -f KEPLER_42
```

**WARNING**: Exoplanet systems often have alternate names (e.g., Kepler-42 c is also known as KOI-961 c). We strongly advise users to consult the NenuFAR schedule to ensure they're using the correct field names.

2. ***Postdoc B would like to investigate the exoplanet ups And b. However, they prefer to use orbital parameters from a specific reference.***

What Postdoc B can do is to activate the MANUAL mode of the tool. The tool provides two modes of driving (like a car):

AUTO mode: the tool sends a query to NASA exoplanet archive, to get the RA/DEC, orbital period and the error, Time of Conjuction (Transit Midpoint) of a specific exoplanet. NASA provides these data from multiple references; so the tool selects the reference with the smallest error in orbital period.

MANUAL mode: the tool still sends a query to NASA exoplanet archive to get the RA/DEC, but requires the user to input the relavant orbital information.

So what Postdoc B can do is inputing orbital information from their prefered reference:

```bash
./orbital_coverage_interactive.py -t ups_and_b -f UPS_AND -m MANUAL -p 4.617033 -pe 0.000023 -j 2450005.368
```
